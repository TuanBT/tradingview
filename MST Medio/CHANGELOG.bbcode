[b]v2.0[/b] (2026-02-11)
[list]
[*][b]Simplified to 2-phase flow[/b] — Removed Phase 3 (Retest). Signal now fires immediately when confirmation is detected (close beyond W1 peak/trough), without waiting for price to return to the entry level.
[*][b]Direct confirmation[/b] — When price closes above W1 peak (BUY) or below W1 trough (SELL), Entry/SL/TP are determined instantly. No intermediate "Phase 2" waiting state.
[*][b]Retroactive scan updated[/b] — Historical scan from W1 bar now confirms directly without Phase 2 retest check.
[*][b]Pending visualization improved[/b] — SL line now shown during pending state. Labels changed from "Phase 1/2" to "Pending BUY/SELL". W1 line always visible while pending.
[*][b]Cleaner state machine[/b] — States reduced from 5 (0, 1, 2, -1, -2) to 3 (0 = idle, 1 = pending BUY, -1 = pending SELL).
[*][b]Raw break guards simplified[/b] — New break detection no longer blocked by Phase 2 state.
