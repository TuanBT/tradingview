[b]PA Break — Price Action Breakout Detector[/b]

Identifies [b]confirmed[/b] price action breakouts based on swing structure (Higher Highs / Lower Lows) with a swing-confirmation state machine. No repainting — signals only appear after the confirming pivot is locked in.

[b]How It Works[/b]
[list]
[*][b]Swing Detection[/b] — Uses pivot highs/lows (left & right lookback) to identify swing points.
[*][b]Break Detection[/b] — A Higher High (HH) signals a potential bullish break; a Lower Low (LL) signals a potential bearish break.
[*][b]Swing Confirmation[/b] — The break is only confirmed when a subsequent swing high forms above the break point (for BUY) or a swing low forms below (for SELL). If price revisits the entry level before confirmation, the pending break is invalidated.
[*][b]Group Entry[/b] — Entry level is set at the strongest swing in the group leading up to the break (highest high for BUY, lowest low for SELL), giving a better risk/reward zone.
[*][b]Stop Loss[/b] — Automatically placed at the last swing low before the break (BUY) or last swing high before the break (SELL).
[/list]

[b]Visual Elements[/b]
[list]
[*][b]▲ Break ✓ / ▼ Break ✓[/b] — Labels at the confirmed break point.
[*][b]Entry line[/b] (dashed) — Extends from the group entry level to the current bar.
[*][b]SL line[/b] (dashed) — Extends from the stop loss level to the current bar.
[*][b]Swing markers[/b] (optional) — Small triangles at detected swing highs and lows.

[b]Inputs[/b]
[list]
[*][b]Pivot Lookback[/b] (default: 5) — Bars left/right to confirm a swing point. Higher = fewer but more significant swings.
[*][b]Break Strength[/b] (default: 0 = OFF) — Minimum break distance as a multiple of the previous swing range. Set > 0 to filter out weak breaks.
[*][b]Show Swing Points[/b] — Toggle swing high/low markers.
[*][b]Show Break Labels[/b] — Toggle "▲ Break ✓" / "▼ Break ✓" labels.
[*][b]Show Break Lines[/b] — Toggle entry and SL dashed lines.
[*]Color inputs for all visual elements.

[b]Alerts[/b]

[*][b]Confirmed Break Buy[/b] — Fires when a bullish break is confirmed.
[*][b]Confirmed Break Sell[/b] — Fires when a bearish break is confirmed.

[/list]

[b]Notes[/b]
[list]
[*]Works on [b]all timeframes[/b] and all instruments.
[*][b]Non-repainting[/b] — Signals use only confirmed (closed) pivots.
[*]This is a [b]detection tool[/b], not a strategy. Use it alongside your own risk management and confluence.
[*]The confirmation mechanism significantly reduces false signals compared to raw HH/LL detection.
