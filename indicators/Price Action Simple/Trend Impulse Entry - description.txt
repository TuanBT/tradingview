█ TREND IMPULSE ENTRY - Simple BUY/SELL

A simple yet effective indicator that generates BUY/SELL signals with clear Entry, Stop Loss, and Take Profit levels.


█ HOW IT WORKS

This indicator combines 3 elements to generate high-quality signals:

1. TREND DIRECTION
   - Uses EMA(50) to confirm main trend
   - Only BUY in uptrend, only SELL in downtrend

2. IMPULSE DETECTION  
   - Identifies strong momentum candles (> 1.5x ATR)
   - These candles show where "big players" entered

3. STRUCTURE CONFIRMATION
   - BUY requires Higher High confirmation
   - SELL requires Lower Low confirmation


█ BUY SIGNAL CONDITIONS

✓ Price is above EMA (uptrend)
✓ A bullish impulse candle appeared (large green candle > 1.5x ATR)
✓ Price makes a Higher High (confirms uptrend continuation)
✓ Risk (Entry - SL) is >= 1 ATR (filters out weak setups)


█ SELL SIGNAL CONDITIONS

✓ Price is below EMA (downtrend)
✓ A bearish impulse candle appeared (large red candle > 1.5x ATR)  
✓ Price makes a Lower Low (confirms downtrend continuation)
✓ Risk (SL - Entry) is >= 1 ATR (filters out weak setups)


█ VISUAL DISPLAY

When a signal triggers, you'll see 3 horizontal lines:
• Blue line (thick) = Entry level
• Red line = Stop Loss level
• Teal line = Take Profit level

Each line has a small text label at the end: "Entry", "SL", "TP"


█ SETTINGS

• Pivot Lookback (5) - Bars to look back for swing detection
• Impulse Size ATR (1.5) - Candle must be >= this x ATR to be impulse
• R:R Ratio (3.0) - Risk:Reward ratio (1:3 default)
• Min Risk ATR (1.0) - Minimum risk size (filters weak signals)
• EMA Period (50) - EMA period for trend detection


█ TRADING TIPS

1. Trade with the trend - This indicator only signals when aligned with main trend
2. Wait for pullback - Signals trigger when price retraces to entry level
3. Respect the SL - Stop Loss is based on impulse key level
4. Adjust R:R - Increase R:R ratio in strong trends for bigger profits
5. Higher timeframes - Works best on H1 and above for cleaner signals

Markets: Forex, Crypto, Stocks, Indices
Style: Swing trading, Day trading


█ ALERTS
