M15 Impulse FVG Entry

M15 Impulse FVG Entry is a minimalist price-action tool designed to highlight structured entry contexts using impulse candles, decision zones, and Fair Value Gap (FVG) logic.

⸻

Core Logic

1. M15 Impulse Candle
A strong M15 candle is identified using ATR expansion and body-to-range ratio.
This candle defines a decision zone (High / Low).

2. IN Candle
Only the first candle that forms fully inside the decision zone after the M15 impulse is considered.
This candle acts as the structural reference.

3. OUT Candle
Price must break cleanly outside the zone.
The previous candle must already close outside the zone.
No reversal is allowed through the IN candle extreme.

4. FVG Entry Context
The gap between the IN candle and the OUT candle forms the Fair Value Gap.
A midpoint between IN and OUT can be used as a potential entry reference.
