[b]M15 Impulse FVG Entry[/b]

M15 Impulse FVG Entry is a minimalist price-action tool designed to highlight structured entry contexts using impulse candles, decision zones, and Fair Value Gap (FVG) logic.

────────────────

[b]Core Logic[/b]

[b]1. M15 Impulse Candle[/b]  
A strong M15 candle is identified using ATR expansion and body-to-range ratio.  
This candle defines a decision zone (High / Low).

[b]2. IN Candle[/b]  
Only the first candle that forms fully inside the decision zone after the M15 impulse is considered.  
This candle acts as the structural reference.

[b]3. OUT Candle[/b]  
Price must break cleanly outside the zone.  
The previous candle must already close outside the zone.  
No reversal is allowed through the IN candle extreme.

[b]4. FVG Entry Context[/b]  
The gap between the IN candle and the OUT candle forms the Fair Value Gap.  
A midpoint between IN and OUT can be used as a potential entry reference.
