[b]MST Medio — Price Action Breakout Confirmation[/b]

MST Medio is a structured price action indicator that detects high-probability entries using a 2-step confirmation process: Break → Confirm. It waits for a confirmed Higher High / Lower Low with an impulse candle, then fires the signal when price confirms momentum by closing beyond the W1 peak.

No repainting. No lagging indicators. Pure price action logic built on swing structure.

[b]How It Works[/b]

[b]Step 1 — Break (HH / LL Detection)[/b]
Price forms a Higher High (HH) above the previous Swing High, or a Lower Low (LL) below the previous Swing Low. The break must pass two quality filters:
[list]
[*][b]Break Strength[/b] — The break distance must exceed a minimum percentage of the previous swing range (configurable, default 0.25×).
[*][b]Impulse Body Filter[/b] — The first candle closing beyond the old high/low must have a body ≥ 1.5× the 20-bar average body. This ensures the break is driven by momentum, not a weak drift.
[/list]
The indicator then identifies the W1 impulse wave — the highest high (BUY) or lowest low (SELL) from the break candle until the first opposing candle. This W1 peak becomes the confirmation level.

[b]Step 2 — Confirm (Signal)[/b]
After the impulse wave, price must pull back and then [b]close beyond the W1 peak[/b] (for BUY) or below the W1 trough (for SELL). This confirms that momentum has resumed after the correction → Signal fires with Entry, SL, and TP.

Invalidation rules:
[list]
[*]Price returns to the entry level (old SH/SL) before confirmation → structure broken, cancel.
[*]Price hits the Stop Loss level → cancel.
[/list]

────────────────

[b]Entry / SL / TP[/b]

[list]
[*][b]Entry[/b] — The old Swing High (BUY) or Swing Low (SELL) that was broken.
[*][b]Stop Loss[/b] — The last Swing Low before the break (BUY) or last Swing High before the break (SELL).
[*][b]Take Profit[/b] — The high of the Confirm candle (BUY) or the low of the Confirm candle (SELL). This represents the point where momentum was confirmed — a natural structural target.

[b]Visual Elements[/b]

[list]
[*][b]Entry / SL / TP lines[/b] (dashed) — Drawn at signal confirmation with labels showing levels and R:R ratio.
[*][b]Risk/Reward zones[/b] — Colored boxes: red zone (Entry → SL) and green zone (Entry → TP) for instant visual assessment.
[*][b]Confirm Break label[/b] — "▲ Confirm Break" / "▼ Confirm Break" at the confirmation candle.
[*][b]Pending state[/b] — Dotted lines for Entry, W1 Peak, and SL levels + "Pending BUY/SELL" label while tracking a potential setup before it triggers.
[*][b]Swing markers[/b] (optional) — Small triangles at detected pivot highs and lows.

[b]Inputs[/b]

[list]
[*][b]Pivot Lookback[/b] (default: 5) — Bars left/right to confirm a swing point. Higher values = fewer but stronger pivots.
[*][b]Break Strength[/b] (default: 0.25) — Break distance must be ≥ this multiple of the previous swing range. Set 0 to disable.
[*][b]Impulse Body Filter[/b] (default: 1.5) — The break candle body must be ≥ this multiple of the 20-bar average body. Set 0 to disable.
[*][b]Show Entry / SL / TP Lines[/b] — Toggle dashed level lines and labels.
[*][b]Show Risk/Reward Zones[/b] — Toggle colored risk/reward boxes.
[*][b]Show Pending State[/b] — Toggle the dotted lines and labels for setups being tracked.
[*][b]Show Confirm Break Label[/b] — Toggle the confirmation label.
[*][b]Show Swing Points[/b] — Toggle swing high/low markers on the chart.
[*]Full color customization for all visual elements.

[b]Alerts[/b]

[list]
[*][b]BUY Signal[/b] — Fires when a bullish setup is confirmed.
[*][b]SELL Signal[/b] — Fires when a bearish setup is confirmed.
[*][b]Any Signal[/b] — Fires on either direction.
[/list]

[b]Notes[/b]

[list]
[*]Works on [b]all timeframes[/b] and all instruments.
[*][b]Non-repainting[/b] — All signals use confirmed (closed) pivots. No lookahead.
[*]This is a [b]detection tool[/b], not a strategy. Use it alongside your own risk management and confluence analysis.
[*]Best suited for trending markets where HH/LL structures form clean impulse waves.
[*]The impulse body filter and break strength filter significantly reduce false signals compared to raw breakout detection.
